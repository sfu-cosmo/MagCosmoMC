# BICEP2/Keck Array likelihood, including external data from Planck and WMAP.
#
# This file contains input parameters to CosmoMC to reproduce the likelihoods 
# of the alternate analysis shown as the blue line on Figure 21 of 
# BICEP2/Keck X. This likelihood differs from the baseline because it allows
# decorrelation of the dust signal with a prior of 1+-0.05 on parameter Delta_d
# and linear scaling with ell. For details of the parameters in the baseline 
# model, see BK15only.ini and BK15.ini, and comments therein.
#
# After generating chains, BK15_08_dc1pm5p_dist.ini can be used with 
# getdist to produce plots of marginalized posteriors.
